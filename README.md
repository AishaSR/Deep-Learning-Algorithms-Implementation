# Deep Learning Algorithms Implementation
This repository contains implementation of different deep learning algorithms in Python. Different library/packages will be used for the implementations like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.

## Multilayer Perceptron

1. The jupyter notebook [neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb](https://github.com/adityashrm21/Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Multilayer_Perceptron/neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb) contains the raw fiddling with a basic implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron.
2. The python script [neural_net_from_scratch.py](https://github.com/adityashrm21/Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Multilayer_Perceptron/neural_net_from_scratch.py) is a cleaner version of the notebook version.
3. The jupyter notebook [tensorflow_mlp_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/adityashrm21/Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Multilayer_Perceptron/tensorflow_mlp_regression.ipynb) contains a tensorFlow implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron with an example using regression on California housing dataset from the `scikit-learn` library.

## Restricted Boltzmann Machine

1. The script [rbm_impl.py](https://github.com/adityashrm21/Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines/rbm_impl.py) contains a basic implementation of a restricted boltzmann machine in python.
