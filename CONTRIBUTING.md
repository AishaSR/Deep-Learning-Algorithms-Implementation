### Aim:
This repository contains the implementation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms from scratch as well as using different libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. The goal is to have a single resource where people can find all kinds of possible implementations of basic algorithms in ML and DL so that this becomes a standard reference for base models and projects involving the use of these algorithms.

### To contribute to the repository:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add the implementation of the algorithm with a clearly defined filename for the script or the notebook.
3. Test the implementation thoroughly and make sure that it works with some dataset.
4. Add a link with a short description about the file in the [README.md](https://github.com/adityashrm21/Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/README.md).
5. Create a pull request for review with a short description of your changes.
6. Do not forget to add attribution for references and sources used in the implementation.
